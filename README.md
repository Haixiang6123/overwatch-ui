# overwatch-ui

A UI library of game Overwatch, built with Vue.js.

## Documentation

For now, I haven't built the documentation website, 
so if all the docs are placed in directory `./docs/*`.
(Click here to view)[./docs].

## Note

**This UI library will reset some styles as followed. 
I strongly recommend you to add these styles to all of your projects :), 
because some CSS bugs can't be found without them.**

```css
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
